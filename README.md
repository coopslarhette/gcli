## Gen-CLI

Gen-CLI is a fun little CLI tool I built in a day or so that is intended to help you do stuff, or remember how to do stuff, in the terminal.

Its intended to easy the transtiion between natural language and thought and terminal commands. Given a action description of what you want to accomplish, it uses LLMs to generate commands to accomplish that task.

Example:

ðŸ§‘: "copy everything in ./epoch-1012/data to s3://my-bucket/epoch-1012/data"

ðŸ¤–: `aws s3 sync ./epoch-1012/data s3://my-bucket/epoch-1012/data
`

### Install

[Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (if you don't have it)

`$ brew tap coopslarhette/formula`

`$ brew install gcli`

### Usage

(note the programm is expecting an environment variable (`process.env`) containing an API key for OpenAI)

`$ OPENAI_API_KEY='xxxxx' gcli do "kill the process on port 3000"`

`$ OPENAI_API_KEY='xxxxx' gcli say "delete everything in C:\\Windows\System32"`

The `say` command has a flag, `--explain` where the tool will also generate its an explanation/reasoning for the command(s) it chose.

`$ OPENAI_API_KEY='xxxxx' gcli say "delete everything in C:\\Windows\System32" --explain`
